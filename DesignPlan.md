# The problem


> Fall in love with the problem - not the solution.


- Many times the first "solution" is not the optimal solution.
- How do we know if the solution is good if we don't know the problem?
- Create and analyze many solutions in parallel.



# Interviews

- Behind every problem, there is a motivation that the user wants to solve while encountering the problem. Always look behind the problem and find the motivation - 5 whys technique.
- Keep in mind that users will try to show you their best during the interview. Try to avoid making interviews with friends and relatives.

8 rules of good questions

#### 1. Do not try to sell your idea. 
Instead, try to figure out the pain-points and if we solve their problems with the product.
  - ~~What do you think about this idea?~~
  - What is your biggest problem and why?
  - What takes away most of your time?
  - What did you do last time when this problem occurred? 
 
#### 2. Do not ask about the future.
Instead, try to ask about the past or the present.  
  - ~~Would you use this product if...?~~
  - How did you solve this problem or how are you solving it right now?
  - How long did it take?
  - How much money do you pay currently, to solve this?
  
#### 3. Do not influence the answer.
Instead, try to release your expectations, and let the subject determine his feelings. 
  - ~~How frustrating was when you encountered that problem?~~
  - Recall the last time when that happened. What were your impressions about that?
  - Say a few feelings about this memory. 
  
#### 4. Do not ask too general questions.
Instead, try to find more perspectives and ask about specific things.
  - ~~How do you use this software?~~
  - What is causing the biggest problem when you use this feature and why?
  - Please go through your last experience with this feature.

#### 5. Do not ask closed questions. 
Instead, ask about stories, why, how, when?
  - ~~What did you buy last time?~~
  - ~~Do you do sports?~~
  - How did you buy last time?
  - When did you do sports last time?
  
#### 6. Do not ask about features, solutions.
Instead, step back and try to find out what is the motivation behind. Find out why.
  - ~~What kind of feature do you want to see in the app?~~
  - Why do you want to see that feature? Why would it help? What would you solve with that feature?
  - What is the ideal way of doing this or that?
  
#### 7. Do not ask about design. 
Instead, see if he can use it. "The 5 seconds test." Design stories: https://blog.uxfol.io/
  - Say a few words about this.
  - Usability test. 
  
#### 8. Do not ask more questions in parallel.
Instead: ask simple questions.
  - Tell me more about when you bought a T-Shirt last time. How did you start? 
  
#### Why? Why? Why?

Find the root of the problem, use the [5 Whys method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakichi_Toyoda).
