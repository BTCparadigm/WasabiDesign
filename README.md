# UX design Overview of Wasabi Wallet, Structure, Functions and Contruction of the UX

## Abstract

Wasabi Wallet is a privacy-focused wallet. However privacy is the primary goal the wallet also has to be usable - moreover, it should be pleasurable to use. We would like to be the most easy-to-use wallet in the era. Wasabi made a lot of steps in this direction but still, more have to be done. The wallet is pretty straight forward to a technical user. A few clicks and you are ready to Send, Receive or CoinJoin. Wasabi is getting more and more popular, the more people there the more privacy we will have. However many users reported Wasabi UX is not too easy to use or not intuitive enough. 

__The goal of this repository is to collect all user-comments together and find the most optimal UI design patterns to ensure a pleasurable interface for everyone.__
