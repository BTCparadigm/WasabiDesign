## Abstract

Wasabi Wallet is a privacy-focused wallet. However privacy is the primary goal the wallet also has to be usable - moreover, it should be pleasurable to use. We would like to be the most easy-to-use and intuitive wallet in the era. Wasabi made a lot of steps in this direction but still, more have to be done. The wallet is pretty straight forward to a technical user. Now with a few clicks, you can install, generate a wallet, send, receive or CoinJoin in the most private way possible. However many users reported Wasabi UX is not too easy to use. Our user base is growing and now we would like to transform Wasabi **to provide a delightful user experience for the everyday bitcoin users**.

__The goal of this repository is to collect all user-comments together, find out the most common problems and create the most optimal UI design patterns to ensure a pleasurable interface for everyone.__

## Problems

We do not want to change the people but to understand them. Why are they doing something like this or that? When there is a UX change or change request there is a motivation behind. First, we need to collect the most problematic things when using a bitcoin wallet in general with one-liners. One-liners force the users to pinpoint the problem without going into a story and/or suggest a solution or a new feature. Later this will be required but right now we are focusing on the problems only.
